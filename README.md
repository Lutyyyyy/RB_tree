# Red-Black tree structure implementation

## Gaussian elimination

I have implemented Red-Black tree data structure with additional `size` parameter (order-statistic-tree)

All the algorithms are taken from Introduction to Algorithms (by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein).

### Installing and running

Prerequisites:
1) gtest should be installed on your system
2) cmake should be installed on your system

1. Create an empty folder where you want to build your project (f.e. it is called build)
2. `cd build`
3. run `cmake .. `
