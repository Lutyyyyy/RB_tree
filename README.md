# Red-Black tree structure implementation

I have implemented Red-Black tree data structure with additional `size` parameter (order-statistic-tree)

All the algorithms are taken from Introduction to Algorithms (by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein).

## Prerequisites

1) gtest should be installed on your system
2) cmake should be installed on your system

## Installing and running
1. Create an empty folder where you want to build your project (f.e. it is called build)
2. `cd build`
3. run `cmake .. `
4. run `make` or `cmake --build`
